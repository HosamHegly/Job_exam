## Part 1: Non-Code Exercises and Solutions

 this repository also includes thoughtful responses to theoretical questions related to the loan offer generation process. These exercises, provided in the PDF "Production QA Exam ," explore various scenarios in the loan application and approval process, such as changes in thresholds, error sources in applications, and the application of debt-to-income (DTI) restrictions.

### Highlights:
1. **Threshold Adjustments**: Explains the impact of changing threshold values on the rate generation model and subsequent processes within the offer system.
2. **Error Sources**: Identifies potential causes of errors in the application process, including data entry errors and API integration issues.
3. **DTI Restriction Timing**: Discusses why the DTI restriction is applied after pricing adjustments, ensuring offers are financially manageable for applicants.
4. **Response Output Analysis**: Detailed analysis of hypothetical applications to identify discrepancies in the offer process based on the rules and models outlined.

### Available in Repository:
- Responses to theoretical questions in a clear, concise manner.
- Analysis of the impact of model thresholds and errors on the final loan offer.
- Evaluation of specific example scenarios provided in the exam to demonstrate the practical application of policies and models.

For more detailed insights, refer to the included PDF document within the repository.



## Part 2 : code
### Finding Words Longer Than N
This Python program accepts a string and an integer `n` as input and returns a list of words from the string that are longer than `n` characters. Useful for text analysis or processing tasks where filtering words by length is required.

### Palindrome Check for Words
This function evaluates a list of strings to determine if each is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward, such as "radar". This function is useful for linguistic studies, puzzles, or applications needing palindrome detection.
